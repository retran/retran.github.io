Hey, I‚Äôm **Andrew Vasilyev**, though online I usually go by **"retran"**. I'm a developer, mentor, and curious human currently living in Amsterdam.

I got into programming early ‚Äî when I was five, I typed my first program from a children‚Äôs book called *"Logibul au pays de l'informatique"*. That one moment sparked a lifelong interest in figuring out how things work and how to make them better.

In school, I competed in programming contests and loved the puzzle-solving side of code. Later, I drifted through game dev experiments, enterprise platforms, and service architectures before finding my place in developer tools and applied AI.

At **Ozon.ru**, I led a small team that built a loyalty system for millions of users ‚Äî which somehow worked on day one. At **Acumatica**, I built an API framework and helped streamline mobile clients development. Later at **1C Company**, I worked on a virtual machine and debugger, and helped plug their dev tools into VS Code and Eclipse.

In 2018, I joined **JetBrains**, where I spent several years building tools for .NET developers. I mentored 8 interns (earning the unofficial title ‚Äúhead of interns‚Äù in the .NET team), ran internal workshops, and co-built features like inlay hints, predictive debugging, and static analyzers for Entity Framework ‚Äî many of which stuck around in ReSharper and Rider. Eventually, I led the **ReSharper AI** team, where we integrated LLMs and RAG into everyday developer workflows. [Here‚Äôs a demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZE92XhZLSs) if you're curious.

Since 2025, I've been at **Uber**, building internal tooling for the Kotlin ecosystem. I also support contributors in the Kotlin ecosystem ‚Äî including Google Summer of Code participants.

Teaching and mentoring have always been close to my heart. I‚Äôve taught "IDE Development" at [Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en/) and [Constructor University](https://www.jacobs-university.de/), and earlier taught programming and machine learning at [Moscow Aviation Institute](https://en.mai.ru/). From 2021 to 2022, I mentored students in algorithms at [Practicum by Yandex](https://habr.com/ru/companies/yandex_praktikum/articles/593039/).

When I‚Äôm not writing code, I like taking apart gadgets, experimenting with compilers, or building little tools just for the fun of it. My [GitHub](https://github.com/retran) is a mix of serious projects and playgrounds.
