Hey, I‚Äôm **Andrew Vasilyev**, though online I usually go by **"retran"**. I'm a developer, mentor, and curious human currently living in Amsterdam.

My programming journey started early ‚Äî when I was five, I typed my first program from a children‚Äôs book called _"Logibul au pays de l'informatique"_. That single moment sparked a lifelong passion for figuring out how things work and how to make them better.

In school, I dove headfirst into programming contests, loving the thrill of solving puzzles. Later, my path drifted through game dev experiments, enterprise platforms, and service architectures before I finally found my calling in developer tools and applied AI.

At **Ozon.ru**, I led a small team that built a loyalty system for millions of users ‚Äî and somehow, it worked flawlessly from day one. At **Acumatica**, I built an API framework and helped streamline mobile client development. Later at **1C Company**, I dove deep into the world of virtual machines and debuggers, and even helped plug their dev tools into VS Code and Eclipse.

In 2018, I joined **JetBrains**, where I spent several years building tools for .NET developers. I had the privilege of mentoring 8 interns (earning the unofficial title of ‚Äúhead of interns‚Äù on the .NET team), running internal workshops, and co-building features like inlay hints, predictive debugging, and static analyzers for Entity Framework ‚Äî many of which are still around in ReSharper and Rider. Eventually, I led the **ReSharper AI** team, where we integrated LLMs and RAG into everyday developer workflows. [Here‚Äôs a demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZE92XhZLSs) if you're curious.

After a short but interesting two-month sprint at **Uber**, where I built internal tooling for the Kotlin ecosystem and supported contributors in the Kotlin world‚Äîincluding Google Summer of Code participants‚ÄîI joined **Nebius** in 2025, where I now work on AI infrastructure.

Teaching and mentoring have always been close to my heart. I‚Äôve taught "IDE Development" at the [Higher School of Economics](https://www.hse.ru/en/) and [Constructor University](https://www.jacobs-university.de/), and earlier in my career, I taught programming and machine learning at the [Moscow Aviation Institute](https://en.mai.ru/). From 2021 to 2022, I mentored students in algorithms at [Practicum by Yandex](https://habr.com/ru/companies/yandex_praktikum/articles/593039/).

When I‚Äôm not writing code, I like taking apart gadgets, experimenting with compilers, or building little tools just for the fun of it. My [GitHub](https://github.com/retran) is a mix of serious projects and playgrounds.
